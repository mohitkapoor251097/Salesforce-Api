 Common Apex Errors and Solutions:

1. Null Pointer Exception: Occurs when trying to access or modify a null object or variable. Always check for null before accessing. Example: if (myObject != null) { // Safe to access myObject }

2. SOQL Query Limit Exceeded: Description includes exceeding the maximum number of queries allowed in a transaction. Optimize queries by combining them efficiently.

3. Too Many DML Statements: Exceeds the maximum number of DML statements allowed in a transaction. Batch DML operations and use collections for bulk updates.

4. Heap Size Too Large: Description notes exceeding the maximum heap size limit. Optimize memory usage by fetching only necessary data.

5. CPU Time Limit Exceeded: Exceeding the maximum CPU time allowed for a transaction. Optimize code to reduce processing time and use asynchronous processing where possible.

6. Mixed DML Operation: Occurs when performing DML operations on setup and non-setup objects in the same transaction. Separate DML operations into different transactions or use asynchronous methods.

7. Field Integrity Exception: Happens when a field value does not meet the fieldâ€™s data type or constraints. Validate field values before DML operations.

8. Unhandled Exception: Occurs when an exception is not caught and handled in the code. Utilize try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
